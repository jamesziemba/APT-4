Started and completed this APT on Feb. 28. It took about a 2 hours.
I did not consult anyone. 
I did not consult any outside resources.
This APT was pretty hard because you first had to break down the teams and figure out their medal count, and then
you had to sort them. I devised a point system that helped in ranking the teams, and then compared the initials of
the countries when there were any ties.
