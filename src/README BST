Started and completed this APT on March 1. It took a couple hours.
I consulted a Cornell CS Dept. PDF re: memoization and StackOverflow.
I did not consult anyone else.
I struggled with this APT. Once I finally was able to get the problem to solve with memoization. Only
the case with n=19 would solve (before that, n=19,n=20, and n=21 would exceed time limit). I tried to
do all I could to reduce runtime, which is why I resorted to defining extra base cases so the 
program would run just that little bit faster. I realize this might not be ideal, but given that I did
not know any other ways to improve my code, this was my only hope.
